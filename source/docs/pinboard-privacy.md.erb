# Pinboard Popup: Privacy Policy

The application or browser extension you just installed never
makes requests to any server in control of the extension
developer, in any capacity.

All that the browser extension does is to trigger the popup code, as
seen on the [Pinboard How-to](https://pinboard.in/howto/) page,
which is a third-party service unaffiliated with the developer,
thus the [Pinboard Privacy Policy](https://pinboard.in/privacy/)
applies.

If you wish, you can inspect the source-code at [github.com/alexandru/pinboard-popup](https://github.com/alexandru/pinboard-popup).
